# Fundamental-Analysis-Bootcamp
With the objective of gaining a strong foundational understanding of financial principles and learning to evaluate stock selection strategies from an investor’s perspective, I undertook a detailed exploration of financial fundamentals. I learned to critically analyze financial statements and valuation metrics to assess business performance and make informed investment decisions. As part of this journey, I developed proficiency in interpreting key financial ratios, including efficiency, return, and leverage ratios—each offering a different lens through which to understand a company's operational and financial health. Applying these skills, I conducted a capstone analysis of companies across multiple sectors, focusing on intrinsic factors such as profitability, solvency, and growth potential to assess their viability from a long-term investment standpoint.
